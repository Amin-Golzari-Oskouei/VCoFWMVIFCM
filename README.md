# Viewpoint-Based Collaborative Feature-Weighted Multi-View Intuitionistic Fuzzy Clustering Using Neighborhood Information 

This repository includes the MATLAB implementation of the IMWFNI_SSIFCM algorithm presented in:

Amin Golzari Oskouei, Negin Samadi, Jafar Tanha, Asgarali Bouyer, and Bahman Arasteh, "Viewpoint-Based Collaborative Feature-Weighted Multi-View Intuitionistic Fuzzy Clustering Using Neighborhood Information," Knowledge-Based Systems (submitted).

Comments are written for all steps of the algorithm for better understanding the code. Also, a demo is implemented for ease of running, which runs by importing the data and other necessary algorithm parameters.
